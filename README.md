Install dependencies by

    opam install menhir cow tiny_httpd

and build by running (requires OCaml >= 4.08.0)

    make

Then, run

    ./aeff.byte file1.aeff file2.aeff ...

This loads all the commands in all the listed files and starts a local HTTP server at http://127.0.0.1:8080/.

The server provides a web interface allows users to click through the reductions of their asynchronous programs. 

For running the examples in `examples/`, also include `pervasives.aeff` in the list of files to load.
